💧 AquaSense: Your Water Quality Navigator
Are you concerned about the quality of water in your community? AquaSense is a powerful tool designed to simplify water quality assessment and management. Whether you're a curious citizen, a field technician, or a researcher, AquaSense helps you turn complex data into actionable insights, ensuring our precious water resources are used wisely.

✨ Features
Predictive Analysis
Don't have a lab full of expensive equipment? No problem! Simply input a single Water Quality Index (WQI) value, and AquaSense will predict a range of key water quality parameters. It will then provide a clear, easy-to-understand assessment of the water's quality, indicating if it's suitable for various uses.

Historical Data Visualization
Wondering how water quality has changed over time in a specific location? Just enter a location and a date range (e.g., mm/01/yyyy to mm/01/yyyy), and AquaSense will generate a dynamic bar chart. This visual representation makes it easy to spot trends and variations over the years, giving you a historical perspective on water health.

Interactive Regional Mapping
For a comprehensive view, you have two options for mapping water quality across a region:

Manual Mapping: Enter a WQI, the number of sampling locations, and the corresponding predicted parameters. Our system will generate a color-coded map that visually represents water quality across the different regions you've specified. This is perfect for detailed, custom analyses.

Automated HTML Mapping: Short on time? Simply provide a valid location address. If the location is in our database, we'll provide its coordinates and generate a downloadable HTML file using Python's Folium and other geo-libraries. This file opens an interactive map in your browser, allowing you to explore parameter values for that specific region with a single click.

🛠️ How it Works
AquaSense uses a combination of data science models to predict parameters from the WQI. For our mapping features, we leverage powerful geospatial libraries to transform numerical data into compelling and user-friendly visualizations. The historical data feature is powered by a robust database that stores and processes water quality information over time.
